    This is an clone of RimWorld.Building_PlantGrower changing the rare ticker to call. the
    base class rare ticker, allowing comps to tick.  RimWorld.Building_PlantGrower does not
    call base.TickRare(), this does.  This building is only really useful if you can comps
    on a Building_PlantGrower which need rare ticking.  It is otherwise the same as the core
    building.
