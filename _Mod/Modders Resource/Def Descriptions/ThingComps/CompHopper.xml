    ThingComp:  CompHopper
    
    Requires:   Building_Hopper
    
    Optional:   PlaceWorker_HopperUserMagnifier
    
    This comp is only usable on Building_Hopper and contains all the low-level functions required
    to internally manage hoppers.  CCL comes with two basic hoppers, a refrigerated an unrefrigerated
    one.  Both of which are hidden unless <UsesGenericHoppers> is set to "true" in ModHelperDef.
    
    Generally speaking there is no need to create your own hoppers as there are two supplied with
    CCL.  You can if you wish to add more functionality to your hoppers, but be aware that any
    building using the generic hopper types can use your hoppers too.  If you do create your own
    hoppers you should also use the PlaceWorker_HopperUserMagnifier to indicate to the player
    the building connection.
    
    Remember, the generic hoppers are directional and rotateable, they will only connect on the
    "north" side (based on default rotation).
